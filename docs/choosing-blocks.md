# Choosing instruction blocks

Choose an agreement you want the project to follow or a recurring problem you
want to address. Skip rules already expressed in repository instructions or
reliably followed by your agent. Selecting no blocks is a valid outcome.

This guide explains editorial choices for the current catalog. The examples
are hypothetical adoption decisions, not observed model improvements. Source
links show the exact instructions that will be installed; this guide adds no
exceptions to those instructions and is not loaded into your project's context.

## `block/tdd` — Test-driven development

[Read the instruction](../catalog/blocks/tdd.md).

- **Consider when:** Your team explicitly wants a failing behavioral test before
  implementation and the project has a practical automated test environment.
- **Skip when:** You prefer testing after exploration, or want test-first work
  only for selected changes. The current block applies to features and bug
  fixes broadly; it does not encode those narrower exceptions.
- **Tradeoff:** Choosing test order as project policy can require test setup
  before you know whether an exploratory implementation is worth keeping.

Example decision: adopt for a maintained parser with executable behavior tests;
skip for a disposable interface prototype whose interactions are still being
decided.

## `block/ponytail` — Minimal implementation

[Read the instruction](../catalog/blocks/ponytail.md). The stable ID retains the
upstream name; the agreement concerns implementation scope.

- **Consider when:** Changes repeatedly acquire unused extension points,
  wrappers, or dependencies, and your team prefers reusing existing facilities.
- **Skip when:** Existing project guidance already establishes that preference
  and changes consistently follow it.
- **Tradeoff:** The smallest safe change depends on the requirements. Planned
  extension points must be stated as requirements so they are not mistaken for
  speculative work. Small diffs alone do not establish correctness.

Example decision: adopt after reviewing an unnecessary provider abstraction for
a project with one required provider; specify the abstraction explicitly when
multiple providers are part of the accepted scope.

## `block/completion-evidence` — Completion evidence

[Read the instruction](../catalog/blocks/completion-evidence.md).

- **Consider when:** Handoffs leave you asking which checks actually ran and
  which parts of the result remain unverified.
- **Skip when:** Your repository or agent already requires and consistently
  produces that evidence. If verification is only an occasional request,
  consider the explicit `command/verify-work` workflow instead.
- **Tradeoff:** Every handoff carries reporting overhead. Repository-required
  checks still need a clear owner; this block does not define a project's test
  suite or guarantee that the checks chosen are sufficient.

Example decision: adopt when a handoff says a UI change is verified but leaves
unclear whether a browser was opened or only an automated check ran. The
[existing calibration](evaluations/records/2026-08-15-completion-evidence.md)
does not establish a measured improvement in real tasks.

## `block/transparent-shortcuts` — Transparent shortcuts

[Read the instruction](../catalog/blocks/transparent-shortcuts.md).

- **Consider when:** Necessary work is deliberately deferred during delivery
  and you want its reason and risk recorded in the project's normal task system.
- **Skip when:** Your delivery workflow already captures these decisions, or
  the supposed deferred work is merely a possible future feature.
- **Tradeoff:** Deciding what is necessary requires judgment. Overuse can turn
  speculative concerns into backlog noise; the block explicitly excludes work
  that is simply out of scope.

Example decision: record a required retry path that is consciously postponed;
do not create a debt item for a speculative multi-region architecture.

## `block/secure-defaults` — Secure defaults

[Read the instruction](../catalog/blocks/secure-defaults.md).

- **Consider when:** The project adds external boundaries such as APIs, file
  imports, or sensitive mutations, and you want a standing agreement about
  validation, access control, and least privilege.
- **Skip when:** Equivalent policy is already enforced by your instructions
  and workflow, or the project does not introduce these boundaries.
- **Tradeoff:** This is broad guidance. It supplies neither a threat model nor
  concrete limits, roles, or authentication choices. Those still belong in the
  project's design. It should not be read as requiring authentication for every
  operation regardless of sensitivity.

Example decision: consider it when introducing a privileged upload endpoint;
identify the permitted callers and size limits in the actual feature requirements.

## `block/ci-production-parity` — CI and production parity

[Read the instruction](../catalog/blocks/ci-production-parity.md).

- **Consider when:** Production runtimes and builds have corresponding CI
  configuration that must change together, especially when the definitions
  live in different files.
- **Skip when:** There is no production build to mirror, or a shared source
  already keeps both paths aligned and your workflow verifies the result.
- **Tradeoff:** Parity is about the relevant runtime and build behavior, not
  identical environments. Production secrets and live services need not be
  copied into CI. The agent still needs to discover which configurations govern
  each path.

Example decision: adopt where a runtime upgrade changes the production image
but could leave CI testing an older runtime. The CLI's CI detection establishes
only that CI exists; it cannot establish this mismatch or a need for the block.

## `block/no-unfinished-ui` — No unfinished UI

[Read the instruction](../catalog/blocks/no-unfinished-ui.md).

- **Consider when:** You want released interfaces to expose usable paths and
  omit controls for features that are not available.
- **Skip when:** The project has no interface, or it is an exploratory prototype
  whose purpose is to show proposed interactions before implementation.
- **Tradeoff:** Hiding unavailable paths can reduce discoverability. The block
  allows an explicitly required disabled or placeholder state; product
  requirements must explain when communicating unavailable behavior matters.

Example decision: omit an export button when export is outside the release
scope; keep an explanatory disabled state when the product explicitly requires
communicating a temporarily unavailable export service.

## Combining and previewing selections

Verification already appears in TDD, minimal implementation, CI parity, and
completion evidence. Installing all four does not establish four independent
benefits. Completion evidence governs the handoff; CI parity adds a specific
configuration obligation. Choose them for those differences.

Check the chosen agreements against existing project policies. For example,
the broad TDD block may conflict with a policy limiting tests to selected kinds
of changes. File preservation and declared catalog conflicts do not detect all
conflicts in natural-language instructions.

Preview an explicit selection before installing it:

```bash
harness-workshop list blocks
harness-workshop add block/no-unfinished-ui --dry-run
harness-workshop add block/no-unfinished-ui
```

The dry run shows the proposed file changes without writing them. Inspect the
canonical source and surrounding project instructions before accepting the
agreement. Editing an installed managed block is treated as local drift; the
guide does not provide a separate local-override mechanism.
